    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Elevator Service mechanics are typically assigned a collection of units (elevators, escalators, and moving walks) to be serviced. \"Callback‚Äù is the term used when referring to elevator maintenance calls made by the customer, which fall outside of the regular maintenance schedule. Sometimes, after a repair or maintenance inspection has been completed, the technician will recieve a callback and have to go back to the jobsite to perform additional maintenance. Other times, a callback will be made to address sporadic issues such as vandalism or unforseen wear and tear.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis, we will investigate a few different hypotheses and choose one the one with the highest potential to add value, following an exploratory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 1. Predict callbacks by weather Conditions ** \n",
    "\n",
    "Callbacks have the potential to be troublesome at times. If there is an unexpected spike in the number of callbacks in a short period of time, it can be difficult to make sure that each unit is serviced in a timely manner. When units go unserviced, customer satisfaction decreases, and if it happens frequently, customers are likely to cancel their  contracts with their service providers. If there was a way to predict a high callback volume apriori, precautions could be made to ensure that every unit is serviced in a timely manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 2. Predict changes in Net Promoter Score using callback information **\n",
    "\n",
    "The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a measure of customer loyalty obtained through customer responses to a survey. The survey may include any number of questions, but it must include the \"NPS question\", which is, \"How likely are you to recommend our company to a colleague or friend?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to the NPS question can range from 0 (not at all likely) to 10 (very likely). Customers who answer 9 or 10 are labeled \"promoters\", those who answer 7 or 8 are labeled \"passives\", and those who answer 6 or lower are labeled \"detractors\". A company's total net promoter score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. In equation form, this is expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$NPS = \\frac{(NumPromoters - NumDetractors)}{NumResponses}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While many in the scientific community argue over the predictive value of the NPS score, it is still percieved by many in industry as a valid metric, and thus provides a sense of value to business leaders. Studying the effect of callbacks on the NPS is a topic of high interest, and modeling how callbacks can positively or negatively impact this score could shed light on how to improve customer relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 3. Predict vandalism utilizing crime rates and geography**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vandalism is a common theme in elevator service calls, and are largely sporadic in nature. Because of this, it is difficult to predict exactly when a vandalism callback will happen. However, it may be possible to predict whether a particular building is more prone to vandalism by looking at crime rates in its general vicinity. "

    "## Problem Statement - Weather and Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "There has always been a \"gut feeling\" among those in the industry that weather patterns may influence callback volumes. To date, however, nobody within our company has done any analysis to confirm or dismiss this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to identify a model which will use weather metrics to predict in advance when a significant change in callback volume will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final outputs should be probability of a callback for a given maintenance call, and a time frame in which it is expected to happen. Note that we limit this to only certain kinds of callbacks, as some callbacks happen due to vandalism and unpredictable occurances within the building, which are independent of weather conditions. The exploratory analysis will likely shed light on the types of callbacks which are weather related.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Readily available, we have callback data for every unit in four major cities dating back to July of 2013. The callback data includes:\n",
    "1. Time and date of callback (when the customer presented the problem)\n",
    "2. Unit type\n",
    "    * Elevator or escalator\n",
    "    * If elevator, what type of elevator?\n",
    "        - Hydraulic\n",
    "        - Roped\n",
    "        - Machine Room/No Machine Room\n",
    "        - Geared motor or Gearless motor\n",
    "3. Mechanic notes (text)\n",
    "4. Fault codes describing which components were maintenanced\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the calback data, we also have weather data from www.ncdc.noaa.gov. This data is fairly limited and is littered with missed observations, but contains daily precipitation (in inches) as well as snowfall.\n",
    "Additional weather data was sourced from www.wunderground.com. This data is much more granular, and includes not only precipitation, but also daily temperature values (high, low, and average), humidity (percentage), windspeed, dew point, and \"events\" (i.e. - thunderstorm, fog, etc.). \n",
    "The wunderground data set will be used primarily as it is more detailed than the noaa data. However, it is good to have two data sets of the same observations to compare values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "** Classification ** \n",
    "\n",
    "   These models can be used to compute the probability of a callback on a particular unit given weather parameters, elevator type, and fault codes. Keywords within mechanic notes could also be predictive of the likelihood of a callback.\n",
    "    \n",
    " Classifier models to be considered include:\n",
    "    \n",
    " 1. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Decision Trees/Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "** Regression **\n",
    "\n",
    "   Regression models can be used to predict the volume of callbacks on a larger scale for a given city or branch. For example, knowing the weather conditions and total number of maintenance calls in Houston for a given week may be enough to predict the total number of callbacks in the coming weeks, without the need to look at the data on such a granular level as would be needed to predict a callback in a specific building or unit. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   Regression Models to be considered include:\n",
    "    \n",
    " 1. Linear Regression\n",
    "    \n",
    " 2. Autoregressive and Moving Average Models (AR, MA, ARIMA)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks and Assumptions\n",
    "**Risks**\n",
    "1. Sometimes callback ticket information is recorded several days after the initial call was made, with no record of when it actually happened. This could lead to predictions which do not reflect the real world.\n",
    "2. There may not be a 'one size fits all' model. We may have to create multiple models, tailored toward specific cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**\n",
    "1. The quality of our weather data is reliable\n",
    "2. The mechanic notes and fault codes were accurately recorded on the job site.\n",
    "3. The quality of certain components and tasks are affected by weather conditions"

    "## Problem Statement - Callbacks and Net Promoter Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create a model which shows how the Net Promoter Score changes with the ratio of callbacks to scheduled maintenance visits. We could approach this as either a classification or regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at individual customers, we can classify them as either promoters, passives, or detractors based on their callback history and how their survey responses change over time. A successful model should correctly classify customers at least 75% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the survey responses and callback volume as a whole, we can use regression models to predict overall customer satisfaction by looking at how the aggregated responses change with number of callbacks. A good regression model should accurately predict overal satisfaction within (+/-) 1 NPS point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the callback data we mentioned in the previous section, we also have roughly 400 responses to NPS surveys dating back to 2013. This data includes customer ID numbers, date of survey, location, and, of course, the answer to the NPS question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the customers taking the survey have the option to input comments. This text data is also included in our data set.\n",

    "** Risks **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We may not have enough customer data to obtain a good prediction\n",

    "## Problem Statement - Predict Vandalism Using Crime Rates and Geography\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated before, vandalism has become routine in service calls, and can be very expensive when technicians have to make special trips outside of their regular service schedules to replace vandalized components. If there was a way to predict probabilities of vandalism by area, companies could charge more for flat-rate service contracts if a building is located in a high-risk area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create a model which will classify locations into different risk categories and predict whether a building will experience a higher volume of vandalism related callbacks than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following an exploratory analysis, criteria for high risk areas will be formed based on geospatial crime statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good model should accurately predict the ratio of vandalism cases to all others with an error of 25% or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial crime statistics have been identified for all but one of the major cities under consideration. This data includes time and date of each offense, type of offense, and either GPS coordinates or a street address. \n",
    "\n",
    "Street addresses may be converted to GPS coordinates using the google maps api or the pygeocoder library. With this information, the risk level of a building may be determined from its proximity to a high-risk zone. \n",
    "\n",
    "The offense types sometimes include traffic violations. For these situations, we would filter out traffic-related offenses, as these tend to happen everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the crime data, our calback data set includes flags and keywords/comments which indicate whether a callback/maintenance visit was due to vandalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models and Methods\n",
    "1. K-nearest-neighbors\n",
    "    * KNN may be used to determine whether a particular address is in a high risk zone, based on the crime rates of its neighboring addresses.\n",
    "2. Gaussian Mixed Models Clustering\n",
    "    * Mixed models could be used to extrapolate a crime density map of each city, which could be used to determine the risk factor of a building address. This would be a good way to validate our model, as visual crime maps are much more accessible online than are machine-readable data sets.\n",
    "3. Linear regression\n",
    "    * Linear regression can be used to calculate the proportion of vandalims to maintenance visist based on the crime rates and types of crimes in an area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks and Assumptions\n",
    "** Risks **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Crime data may be insufficient/too sparse in some cities\n",
    "2. Crime data may be out of date for some cities undergoing gentrification\n",
    "3. The types of crime in our data sets may not be indicative or related to vandalism\n",
    "\n",
    "** Assumptions **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There exist certain zones within cities with higher rates of crime, which suggests that elevators in these regions may be at a higher risk to be vandalized\n",
    "2. If Gaussian mixed models are used, we assume that the crime is normally distributed around a finite number of central locations.\n",
    "3. Traffic violations do not significantly contribute to the crime density of a given location"
